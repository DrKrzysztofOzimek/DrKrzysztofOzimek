# 👋 Hi, I’m Dr Krzysztof Ozimek

Welcome to my GitHub!  
**I work independently — as an educator in model-based finance | financial analyst & researcher | quantitative investor & trader.**

---

👀 My expertise spans **12 key domains of Quantitative Finance**, including:  
**Asset Pricing**, **Corporate Finance**, **Financial Econometrics**, **Financial Mathematics**,  
**Investment and Trading**, **Machine Learning in Finance**, **Market Microstructure**, **Neural Networks**,  
**Portfolio Optimization**, **Risk Management**, **Statistics and Probability**, and **Stochastic Modelling**.

🌱 I deepen my expertise daily through **books**, **academic papers**, **hands-on coding**,  
and **blogging** — especially in **quantitative finance**, **AI**, and **data science** —  
and I regularly share insights through **YouTube** and **LinkedIn**.

💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on: **E-learning courses, commercial or open-source tools, blog content,  
and educational projects in quantitative finance — especially applications of data science and AI  
to financial modeling, algorithmic trading, and portfolio management**

⚡ Fun fact: I was the **Champion of the Baltic Republics of the USSR** in the **4×C-1 canoe relay race** (August 1988).  
Quantitative finance wasn’t my first competition!
